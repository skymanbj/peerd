# compute-ocr-sri.sh — compute SRI hashes for the opt-in OCR engine assets.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/compute-ocr-sri.sh <url> [<url>...]
#   scripts/compute-ocr-sri.sh            # uses the URLs baked into OCR_ASSETS
#
# For each URL, downloads the bytes, computes SHA-384, and prints a base64
# SRI hash in the form `sha384-<base64>` plus the byte size. Paste each
# into the matching asset in
# peerd-runtime/pdf/ocr-store.js OCR_ASSETS (the `sri` / `sizeBytes` fields).
#
# Why this matters
# ----------------
# The OCR engine (Tesseract core WASM + a language model) is downloaded on
# demand from a CDN. Without SRI verification, a CDN compromise could swap in
# a tampered binary. peerd refuses to cache any asset whose computed SHA-384
# disagrees with the pinned value, and PRODUCTION refuses to download at all
# until every `sri` is pinned (hasValidOcrSris) — the same fail-closed posture
# as the Moonshine voice model.
#
# Caveat: SRI is tied to a SPECIFIC URL (a pinned npm/CDN version). If you bump
# a URL, re-run this and update the constants. Use version-pinned URLs.
