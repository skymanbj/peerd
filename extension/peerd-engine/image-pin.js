// VM base-image integrity pin — the pure decision logic.
//
// THE TRUST BOUNDARY, honestly stated: CheerpX's HttpBytesDevice /
// CloudDevice stream the Debian rootfs ext2 image block-by-block from
// inside the vendored runtime (vendor/cheerpx/). There is no hook to
// observe or verify those reads, and a whole-file SRI hash is
// impossible by construction — the device exists precisely so the ~2GB
// image is never downloaded in full. Verifying EVERY streamed block
// would take a per-block hash manifest plus a custom CheerpX block
// device that re-aligns arbitrary byte ranges to manifest chunks; that
// is a wrong-layer hack against a vendored internal and we deliberately
// don't do it (documented gap — see the boot-time why-comment in
// vm-tab.js).
//
// What we CAN do cleanly, and do here: trust-on-first-use pin the
// image's cheap identity — total byte size (from Content-Range) plus
// the SHA-256 of its first 64 KiB — fetched by OUR code (one ranged
// request) before the vendored device ever opens the URL. This targets
// the failure mode that actually corrupts user data: the bytes behind the pinned image URL
// changing after per-VM overlays have cached base blocks (CheerpX has
// NO invalidation mechanism — a changed base silently corrupts every
// existing overlay). It does NOT defend against a malicious host that
// serves a faithful head and tampered tail; that residual risk is the
// documented trust boundary: we trust disks.webvm.io to keep serving
// the same bytes, and we now FAIL CLOSED if the cheap evidence says it
// didn't.
//
// This module is pure (values in, decision out); the vm-tab boot path
// injects the fetch/digest/storage IO.

/**
