// @ts-check
// background/offscreen-actor-client.js: the privileged-host client for EVERY isolated
// agent loop (the heap split): ephemeral spawned reasoners (spawn.js) AND bound
// actors (the actor turn). One client, one set of routes (model-call + tool-dispatch
// + loop-event); a reasoning child grants no tools, so it only ever exercises
// model-call.
//
// The security-critical route is 'actor/tool-dispatch': the worker's loop asks to run
// a tool; THIS builds the actor's instance-PINNED, gated tool context and dispatches
// there — the pin, the gate, the engine clients, the tabs, and the audit are ALL
// SW-side. It NEVER trusts the worker's call args (they may derive from injected
// instance/page output): it re-pins the bound instance and runs the full gate,
// with the same policy on every browser host.
//
// Pure shell — every IO injected — so it is unit-testable without a browser.

// An inbound dweb wake is reasoning over bytes chosen by a remote peer. Keep its
// useful read/moderation surface, but do not advertise any operation that can
// delegate, spend, sign/publish, install peer code, or change standing network
// policy. This is a POSITIVE set so a future dweb capability lands unavailable to
// inbound turns until somebody deliberately classifies it here.
