// @ts-check
// The settings ROW — one setting, readable at a glance (P1 of the UI redesign).
//
// What it replaces: an <h3>, one or two dense paragraphs, and a button labelled
// with its own inverse ("Turn off write confirmations"). Eleven of those stacked
// on Behavior meant the page carried its state in prose — you read a paragraph
// to learn whether a thing was on, and a safety-critical setting looked exactly
// like a cosmetic one.
//
// The row instead says three things in a fixed order: WHAT it is (label), WHETHER
// it is on (pill + toggle, both readable without reading), and WHAT THAT MEANS
// right now (one line, present tense). The rationale that used to be the whole
// block collapses behind "Why this matters" — available, never the default
// reading.
//
// why a shared component and not markup inside behavior.js: the same row is what
// the other settings pages want, and a pattern that lives in one page's view
// function gets re-typed slightly differently on the next page. That drift is
// exactly what made two surfaces render the same tab title two different ways
// (see prompt-wrap.js safeTitle).
//
// TIERS. `band: 'safety'` raises the group and rules it; everything else sits
// flush. That is the only visual difference, and it is deliberate: a user
// skimming for "what can peerd do to me" should find those four rows without
// reading a word of copy.
