// dpop/keys — the SHELL for DPoP: a proof-of-possession key peerd can USE but
// can never READ, plus the hashing/signing that turns dpop/proof.js's pure
// shaping into a real RFC 9449 proof.
//
// THE WHOLE POINT, in one line: `generateKey(..., false, ...)`.
//
// The `false` is the `extractable` argument, and it is NON-NEGOTIABLE. A
// non-extractable CryptoKey is a HANDLE — the private scalar lives inside the
// browser's crypto implementation and there is no API, from any in-origin code,
// that returns its bytes. `crypto.subtle.exportKey` on it REJECTS. So:
//   - the agent can't read it (it never has the handle at all — the handle
//     never leaves the SW, and never enters a keyless actor heap),
//   - a prompt-injected or outright compromised service worker can't read it,
//   - a malicious co-extension that somehow reached our IDB can't read it,
//   - a heap dump / OPFS scrape / IDB export doesn't contain it.
// The honest residual is stated in THREAT-MODEL.md INV-15: non-extractability
// prevents EXFILTRATION, not USE — code running in-origin while the key is
// resident can still ask for a signature. That is bounded by the origin binding
// (a proof is minted only for the exact owned https origin), by the fact that
// proofs are minted only at the audited egress chokepoint, and by the audit log.
//
// why a CryptoKey can be PERSISTED at all: CryptoKey is structured-cloneable,
// so IndexedDB stores the HANDLE while the key material stays inside the
// implementation. That is what lets the key survive an MV3 service-worker
// eviction without ever becoming bytes we hold.
//
// Functional core / imperative shell: every IO seam here is INJECTED —
// `load`/`save` (the persistence pair), `generate`, `now`, and `subtle`. The
// production wiring hands `makeDpopKeyStore` the idb primitives; nothing in this
// file imports storage.

 *
 * THE LIFECYCLE RULE, and why it is a security rule: a key is minted ONLY when

 * a `jkt` the authorization server has bound a live token to, so a transient IDB
 * hiccup would permanently 401 the integration with nothing in the logs to explain
 * it. Failing closed instead costs one anonymous request and self-heals on the
 * next call, when the store may well read fine.
 *
 * A record that loaded but is NOT the key INV-15 describes (`usableDpopPrivateKey`
