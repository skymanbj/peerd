// @ts-check
// webFetch — egress wrapper for arbitrary web tools.
//
// safeFetch is intentionally narrow: provider endpoints ONLY. That
// invariant defends the "even if the agent is prompt-injected, it
// can't exfiltrate the conversation" property. The web tools (fetch_url +
// the web actor's drive-a-tab path) need to reach arbitrary HTTPS hosts the
// user might be reading; they go through THIS function, not safeFetch.
//
// What webFetch DOES enforce:
//   - http / https schemes only (no file://, chrome://, etc.)
//   - a PRIVATE-NETWORK block (SSRF defense): no LAN / loopback / link-local
//     targets. The denylist can't express IP ranges, so this is a separate
//     pure guard ahead of it (private-network.js). Closes the LAN-scan /
//     localhost-service vector; see that file for what it deliberately does
//     NOT cover (DNS rebinding, arbitrary public-domain exfil).
//   - the denylist — banks, health portals, password managers, etc.
//     The origin gate at the dispatcher already checks this for any
//     tool that declares its origins(), but we duplicate the check
//     here so a malformed tool that returns an empty origin list
//     can't bypass the denylist via raw webFetch.
//   - audit on both allow and deny so the user has visibility.
//
// What webFetch deliberately does NOT enforce:
//   - a per-host allowlist. Web is fundamentally open; trying to
//     allowlist arbitrary domains would either over-restrict (block
//     legitimate reads) or under-restrict (defeat the point). The
//     denylist + per-tool confirmation gates are the right knobs.

// the target is SAME-ORIGIN as the tab it owns — there it is already in the user's
// session via the rendered tab, so a credentialed fetch to that origin is no
// escalation (and the actor never holds a credential: the BROWSER attaches the
// origin's cookies; keyless is intact). Everything CROSS-ORIGIN — or any request
// with no owned tab — stays SESSIONLESS, so a prompt-injected actor can never point
// a credentialed fetch at a DIFFERENT site the user is logged into and read it out.
// The decision is the boundary's: a tool cannot opt a cross-origin request into
// credentials, because it never supplies the credentials value at all.

 *   5.   both slots stripped, then set last-wins.
 *   6.   the audit records the origin + the public `jkt` thumbprint ONLY — never
 *        the token, never the proof, never any key material.
 *   7.   fail closed and SILENT: a locked vault, a missing key, or a failed
 *        signature all send the request ANONYMOUS, with no throw. An unsigned
 *        token is never sent as a consolation prize.
 *   8.   the server-nonce dance (§8) is handled HERE and nowhere else: a cached
 *        nonce rides the first proof, and a nonce challenge earns exactly ONE
 *        re-signed retry. See dpop/nonce.js for every condition on that retry;
