// @ts-check
// Egress allowlist — the most important security primitive in V1 (§4.5).
//
// `safeFetch` wraps the global fetch and refuses any request to a host
// that is not on the allowlist. Bare `fetch` is forbidden everywhere in
// the project (ESLint rule in .eslintrc.cjs; the few exceptions —
// system-prompt loader, this file, storage wrappers — are explicit
// overrides in the same config).
//
// What this defends against (the CREDENTIALED provider path only):
//   - The conversation, plus the API key, being POSTed to a non-provider
//     host by a prompt-injected agent or a malicious/compromised adapter
//   - A tool that holds the vault key trying to phone home
//
// What this DOES NOT govern — be honest, this is a partial control:
//   - The OPEN-WEB tool path. fetch_url / vm_import go through webFetch
//     (peerd-egress/fetch/web-fetch.js),
//     which is allowlist-FREE by design — it reaches arbitrary public
//     HTTPS hosts. webFetch enforces a scheme check, an SSRF/private-
//     network block, the sensitive-site denylist, and audit, but NOT a
//     per-host allowlist. So exfil/C2 to an arbitrary PUBLIC domain over
//     the open-web path is NOT prevented here; the architectural
//     mitigation is that fetch_url is web-actor-only and that context is
//     KEYLESS — the capability strip (actor/spawn.js) removes getSecret /
//     safeFetch, so an injected page can't launder the user's credentials
//     out over webFetch (see web-fetch.js).
//   - Network requests originating from web pages the agent is browsing
//     (normal browser CORS + the denylist §4.2)
//   - Requests from inside the WebVM — those go through CheerpX's
//     emulated socket layer, which we route through webFetch when the VM
//     has network enabled (off by default per DECISIONS.md)
//
// What is on the allowlist:
//   - The "hardcoded" set (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama loopback) — these
//     are non-negotiable in code; turning them off requires editing this
//     file and a code review.
//   - User-added provider endpoints, persisted in chrome.storage.local
//     under `provider_endpoints.v1`. Adding goes through an explicit
//     per-endpoint "you are adding api.example.com" confirmation flow
//     (peerd-provider/registry.js + a per-host runtime grant flow —
//     not built yet; see TODO.md "Followups").
