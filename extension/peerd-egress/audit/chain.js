// @ts-check
// audit/chain.js — the audit log's tamper-evidence hash chain (R4).
//
// Each appended entry carries `chain` = SHA-256 over (the previous
// entry's chain ‖ this entry's canonical core). A separate tiny head
// record (audit_meta store) pins the id+chain of the NEWEST entry, so
// verification detects all four naive tamperings: a rewritten entry
// (its own chain no longer matches), a deleted middle entry (its
// successor's chain no longer matches), a truncated tail (head record
// disagrees with the last entry), and a reordered log (uuidv7 order and
// chain order diverge). Retention pruning stays legal: only the OLDEST
// entries are removed, and the first retained entry's chain is accepted
// as the anchor.
//
// Honest scope (the threat model's R4 wording matches): this is
// tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-PROOF. An attacker with code execution in
// the extension origin can recompute the whole chain forward and update
// the head; without a secret the origin does not hold, no in-origin
// scheme can prevent that. What this closes is silent, cheap
// tampering — and it makes the debug bundle's audit slice a checkable
// artifact rather than a claim.
//
// Pure over injected values (crypto.subtle is compute, not IO) —
// bun-tested without a browser.
