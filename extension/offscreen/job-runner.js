// @ts-check
// offscreen/job-runner.js — runs a HEADLESS JS job in a sealed Worker.
//
// The headless sibling of the Notebook tab's runEval (DECISIONS #25, "runJob"):
// the SAME sealed worker (worker-source.js — realm seal first, peerd.* surface,
// the fetch/opfs/actor bridges), but hosted in the offscreen document with NO
// UI, an EPHEMERAL OPFS scratch that is nuked when the job ends, and output
// ACCUMULATED into the return value. Egress + actor relay through the SAME
// audited SW routes the tab uses (sw/web-fetch, actor/spawn), so
// denylist + SSRF + audit are enforced centrally regardless of host.
//
// SECURITY — defense-in-depth is WEAKER here than the tab, by one layer, and
// that is deliberate + bounded:
//   • The Notebook tab page has TWO fences: the realm seal AND a page CSP of
//     `connect-src 'none'`. The offscreen document's CSP allows `https:` (it
//     MUST, to download the Moonshine voice model), and a blob worker inherits
//     its owner document's CSP — so a headless worker has NO `connect-src 'none'`
//     backstop. It relies on the realm seal ALONE.
//   • That is acceptable because runJob runs the agent's OWN semi-trusted code,
//     and the seal is the PRIMARY fence: it deletes fetch/XHR/WS/etc. and pins a
//     postMessage-bridged fetch (the seal tests prove it can't be unseated from
//     inside the realm). The CSP only ever mattered as a seal-ESCAPE backstop.
//   • Do NOT run UNTRUSTED code here — that needs a real origin boundary (the
//     opaque-origin iframe / "App without UI", DESIGN.md §8.5), not a Worker.
//   • Hardening path if the backstop is wanted: spawn the worker from a
//     same-origin iframe carrying its own `connect-src 'none'` meta-CSP.
