//     (main / actor / review / direct) is REFUSED any of them —
//     so a one-line `actor_create({tools:['app_delete']})` can't escalate.
//     Originally only MUTATION was tiered and the fenced READS
//     (app_read_file/app_list_files/js_read_file) stayed global for cheap
//     no-actor-hop inspection; that was reversed (owner call 2026-07-05) —
//     an instance file is not reliably agent-authored (notebook/app code
//     fetches and persists web data), so even a fenced read hands untrusted
//     bytes to the orchestrator's context. The convenience broke the
//     isolation premise; reads now ride the actor heap like everything else.
//   - An actor is POSITIVELY constrained to its own kind's toolset
//     (actorAllowedTools) — a keyless, narrow trust model: a
//     hallucinated/injected non-env tool from an actor fails closed at the
//     gate, not just in the descriptor list.

// App/Notebook code became diff-only, which makes them materially worse.

// outward closure at all (verified in review.test.ts: no safeFetch/webFetch/
// dweb/messageActor/spawnActor survives its capability strip), cannot recurse,

// stay out of the orchestrator's key-holding heap — is upheld either way. What
