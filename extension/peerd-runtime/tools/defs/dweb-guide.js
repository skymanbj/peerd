//
// The multiplayer/bridge how-to is bulky, and most sessions never build a shared
// dwapp — so it does NOT live in the system prompt. The short dweb block tells the
// agent to call this tool FIRST when building a multiplayer/shared App; the full
// client + ops + events + game pattern arrives only then. Read-only, no IO, no
// confirm — it just returns reference text. dweb-only.

import { oncePerSession } from './once-per-session.js';

// why a const string, not a fetched asset: it's the tool's payload, versioned with
// the tool; keeping it inline means no extra fetch + no store-pruning surprises.
const BRIDGE_GUIDE = `dwapp bridge — build a MULTIPLAYER / shared App.

STEP 0 — CREATE THE APP AS A DWAPP, or there is no bridge:
  sandbox_create({ kind: 'app', name, files, dwapp: true })   // dwapp:true is REQUIRED
The dwapp:true flag is what makes the app-tab attach the bridge. WITHOUT it the
app is an ordinary sandboxed app, window.parent never answers hello(), and you'll
get "no dweb bridge — open this inside peerd" no matter how correct your client
code is. (Grow it with app_write_file afterward; the dwapp marking persists.)

DON'T externally navigate the document with location.* — the offline sandbox blocks it.
Fragment links and same-document history state remain local and are fine.
Switch screens (lobby → game) by showing/hiding DOM. Buttons and JS-handled forms
work; meta-refresh is stripped. External links are mediated by peerd's trusted
host and require the user to approve opening them.

An App you build talks to the network through the dwapp bridge: it posts a request
to window.parent and listens for replies + events. Raw fetch/XHR/WebSocket/WebRTC
and remote scripts, styles, images, fonts, media, and frames are blocked — the
bridge is the dwapp's ONLY network path. Drop this minimal client INLINE
into the app's HTML — in a <script> tag in the page, NOT a separate bridge.js the
game imports. why: the sandbox has no file server, so cross-file ES module
import/export between your files does not resolve (the app would silently never
start — "Connecting…" forever). Keep all the JS in inline/classic <script> tags
(they share one global scope) or one self-contained <script type=module>. Note the
exact message keys — peerd:'dweb' out, peerd:'dweb:result' / peerd:'dweb:event' in;
NOT type:'dweb':

  const clientId = crypto.randomUUID(); const pend = new Map(); const subs = new Map();
  const call = (op, args = {}) => new Promise((res, rej) => {
    const id = crypto.randomUUID(); pend.set(id, { res, rej });
    parent.postMessage({ peerd: 'dweb', id, clientId, op, args }, '*');
  });
  const on = (ev, cb) => subs.set(ev, [...(subs.get(ev) || []), cb]);
  addEventListener('message', (e) => { const m = e.data; if (!m) return;
    if (m.peerd === 'dweb:result' && m.clientId === clientId) { const p = pend.get(m.id); if (p) { pend.delete(m.id); m.ok ? p.res(m.value) : p.rej(new Error(m.error)); } }
    else if (m.peerd === 'dweb:event') (subs.get(m.event) || []).forEach((cb) => cb(m.data)); });
  addEventListener('pagehide', () => {
    for (const id of pend.keys()) parent.postMessage({ peerd:'dweb:cancel', clientId, id }, '*');
    parent.postMessage({ peerd:'dweb:dispose', clientId }, '*');
  });

Ops (all via call): hello() -> {available, did, joined}. join({roomId, name}) ->
the shared space (pick a roomId, e.g. the game name). leave(). publish({topic,
data, retain}) -> broadcast to everyone in the room on a topic (retain:true keeps
it for late joiners). subscribe({topic}). history({topic}) -> past retained
messages. dm-send({to, data}) -> a private 1:1 message to one peer's did.
presence() -> who is here. announce({meta:{name}}) -> set your display name.

Events (via on): 'message' {topic, from, data, ts, id} someone published; 'direct'
{from, data} a dm to you; 'presence-join' {did, meta}; 'presence-leave' {did}.

Pattern for a 2+ player game: on load call hello() then join({roomId:'<game>',
name}); subscribe({topic:'move'}); on 'message' for 'move' apply the opponent's
move (data says who + what); on your own move publish({topic:'move', data});
presence-join/leave shows who is playing. The commons app in the Library is the
full worked reference. \`from\` on every event is the signed sender did, set by the
platform, so a peer cannot spoof another; \`data\` is opaque bytes, put whatever you
need in it.

Build the app first — sandbox_create({ kind:'app', ..., dwapp: true }) + the app actor's writes — wired to
the bridge, test it, then dweb_share it so friends can install and play.`;
