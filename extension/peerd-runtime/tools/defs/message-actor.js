// message_actor — talk to the agent that OWNS a tab-hosted instance.
//
// DESIGN-17: each WebVM / Notebook / App is driven by an ACTOR (a per-instance
// agent that exclusively holds that environment's tools). The main agent no
// longer mutates an instance by id; it messages the instance's actor, which
// does the work in its own focused context and replies on a later turn. Thin
// wrapper — the mailbox / sender-gate / runaway-guard / correlation all live in
// actor/actor-messaging.js (bound + injected as ctx.messageActor by the
// SW). The exposure gate refuses this tool on an actor session, so an actor
// can't recursively message another actor.

// why a wall-clock cap on the orchestrator's opt-in await: the orchestrator's
// turn has NO timeout of its own (only user Stop), so a slow or hung web
// delegation awaited in-band would block the turn indefinitely. At the cap the
// await DEGRADES TO ASYNC — the actor is NOT cancelled, it keeps working and its
// reply lands as the usual later-turn fenced note — so the user gets a prompt
// "still working" answer instead of a frozen turn. A few minutes: long enough
// that most primary web tasks resolve in-band, short enough to never read as
// hung. Ephemeral children don't use this — their awaitSignal is their own
// wall-clock cap, and they have no later turn to degrade to.
