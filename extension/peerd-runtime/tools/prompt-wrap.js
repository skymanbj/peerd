// @ts-check
// Untrusted-content wrapping (per DESIGN.md §4.3).
//
// Web tool output (read_page, screenshot, anything that pulls text from
// a page the user/agent navigated to) gets wrapped in a structured tag
// before being handed back to the model. The agent's system prompt
// teaches it to treat text inside these tags as DATA, not as COMMANDS —
// raising the bar against prompt injection sourced from page content.
//
// This is one part of a defense-in-depth chain:
//   - Egress allowlist (safeFetch)   — locks the CREDENTIALED provider path
//                                      (open-web webFetch is allowlist-free)
//   - SSRF / private-network block   — no LAN / loopback / metadata targets
//   - Denylist                       — won't touch banking/health/etc.
//   - Plan/Act + denylist            — scope-limits what the agent may act on
//   - Untrusted wrap (this file)     — clear data/instruction boundary
//   - User confirmation gate         — explicit ack on side-effects
//
// The wrap happens at the tool boundary — read_page calls this in its
// execute(), not in the agent loop — so it's impossible to forget when
// adding a new web-sourced tool.

// the fence and smuggle the text after it back as un-fenced "instructions".
// This is a STRUCTURAL break-out defense (attacker bytes can't forge the
// delimiter), distinct from the soft "treat the inside as data" rule the
// system prompt teaches the model.
// peerd_file is the @-mention file fence (composer/resolvers.js): an inlined
// App/Notebook file is reference DATA, and its body may itself be scraped web
// text, so it gets the same structural break-out defense.
