// @ts-check
// The egress allowlist, implemented AS a default pre-tool-use hook.
//
// This is the deliberate dogfooding the §10 design calls for: peerd's
// single most important security primitive — the network-origin
// allowlist that `safeFetch` enforces (peerd-egress/fetch/safe-fetch.js)
// — is re-expressed here as a pre-tool-use hook. The point is to prove
// the hook model is load-bearing: if the allowlist can be a hook, the
// hook layer is a real policy chokepoint, not a toy observer.
//
// HOW IT RELATES TO safeFetch. safeFetch is still the hard floor inside
// peerd-egress: any tool that calls ctx.safeFetch() is checked there too,
// belt-and-suspenders. This hook adds a SECOND, EARLIER veto at the
// dispatcher layer — it inspects a tool call's declared origins BEFORE
// execute() runs, so a network tool whose target is off-allowlist is
// blocked before it ever reaches its body. Defense in depth: the gate
// chain checks the denylist (origin gate), this hook checks the egress
// ALLOWLIST, and safeFetch checks again at the actual fetch boundary.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED. A tool that declares no origins is allowed (nothing to
// check). A tool that declares an origin we can't parse is BLOCKED — an
// unparseable target is exactly the shape an injection uses to smuggle a
// request past a naive check. The hook reads the live allowlist from the
// tool context (ctx.allowlist), injected by the SW, so user-added
// provider endpoints are honored without rebuilding the hook.
//
// Scope: the agent's OWN outbound fetches only. Browser-session tools
// (primitive 'tab' — open_tab, navigate, type, click…) are EXEMPT:
// they act on the user's logged-in browser (peerd's whole thesis), gated
// by the denylist + confirmation, not the provider allowlist. Of the rest,
// only sideEffect 'mutate_external' is in scope; read/write tools that
// touch no external origin skip entirely (`origins()` returns []).
