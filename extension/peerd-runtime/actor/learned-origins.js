// @ts-check
// peerd-runtime/actor — the origins peerd LEARNED the user has an account on.
// (issue #251, the half that grows with use.)
//
// The two seeds next door (a curated UGC zone, a stored vault credential) will
// never be a complete list of where someone is signed in, and a classifier that
// fails open is only as good as its inputs. This is the input that improves on
// its own, from data ordinary use already produces.
//
// THE TWO SIGNALS, and why these and not the obvious one:
//
//   password-field   A password input was seen by the standalone exact-document
//                    probe at the DOM-tool chokepoint. Nothing else on the web
//                    says "this site has accounts" as plainly; only its boolean
//                    result reaches this store.
//   confirmed-write  The user approved a `web:write` to this origin. They
//                    affirmed acting there under their own name; we are only
//                    remembering that they did.
//
// The obvious signal — "does this origin have cookies" — needs the `cookies`
// permission, which is a broad ask on a store-reviewed extension and the same
// reasoning that kept `webNavigation` out. Both signals here are byproducts of
// data we already hold.
//
// WHAT LEARNING CAN AND CANNOT DO HERE. No AUTOMATIC path in this file makes an
// origin ordinary again, and that asymmetry is deliberate: a false positive
// costs a handoff, a false negative costs a roaming actor loose on a site the
// user is logged into. That is why the cap refuses to learn rather than evicting
// (see `note`), and why nothing decays.
//
// `forget`/`clear` are the ONE exception, and only because the caller is the
// user, not a heuristic. The whole store is a guess AT a fact the user knows for
// certain — whether they have an account somewhere — so a person saying "not
// this one" is better evidence than the password field we inferred it from, and
// refusing to accept it does not make anyone safer: it just leaves a wrong guess
// permanent and invisible. What must never call these is anything acting on
// page-derived input; the SW exposes them on the settings routes only, which the
// agent and its actors cannot reach.
//
// PURE-ISH: an in-memory Map is the read path (the classifier's check is
// synchronous), durable storage is injected and write-only-behind. Nothing here
// imports IO.
