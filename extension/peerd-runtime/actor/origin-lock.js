// @ts-check
// peerd-runtime/actor — the origin lock's imperative shell (issue #251).
//
// The POLICY is pure and lives next door (landing-rule.js decides,
// origin-sensitivity.js classifies). This binds it to a live actor: reads the
// actor's mode and owned origin, asks the rule, persists what changed, and
// reports what happened. All IO is injected, so the shell is testable without a
// browser and the SW's wiring stays a few lines.
//
// WHERE IT IS ENFORCED, AND WHERE IT IS NOT. The RULE, stated structurally so it
// survives the code growing: `judgeLanding` is called wherever a tool resolves or
// observes a tab's LIVE url. Today that is three places —
//
//   * `resolveTargetTab` — every DOM tool, on the tab's current URL
//   * `navigate` — again, on the URL it just landed on; the only point in the
//     tree that observes a landing as it is CREATED, which is what catches a 302
//     nobody made a tool call for
//   * `site_capture` — which needs the tabId rather than the Tab and so does not
//     pass through the resolver at all
//
// The list is enumerated because it must be kept in sync, and named as three
// because an earlier version of this header said "two" after the third had
// already been added in the same arc — a map that is wrong is worse than no map,
// since the next reader will trust it about what is unjudged.
//
// That covers the DOM surface. It does NOT cover every way the actor's session
// authority can be spent, and an earlier draft of this header wrongly implied it
// did. The web actor also holds `fetch_url`, `read_web_cache` and the
// `site_client_*` tools, none of which pass through `resolveTargetTab`. Their
// credential scope is `ctx.activeTab.origin`, read live — so a page that
// redirects itself to a credentialed origin moves that scope with no tool call
// to judge, and those tools could spend it before any DOM tool re-entered the
// chokepoint.
//
// `makeCredentialScope` below is the answer to that, and it is a DIFFERENT shape
// on purpose: synchronous, so it can sit inside the credential-scope getter the
// egress wrapper already reads live on every request. It withholds the scope
// rather than refusing the call, so it can only ever narrow what the pre-#251
// code handed over. What remains uncovered is a SESSIONLESS cross-origin fetch,
// which is exactly what those tools do today when off-origin — no authority to
// take away.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, and must not silently appear to. On a `handoff` it
// records the successor origin and ends the actor — it does NOT mint the bound
// actor or forward a goal. Routing is the orchestrator's, and the goal text must
// be re-authored there rather than carried over from a possibly-hijacked roaming
// actor. If a future change makes this file forward actor-authored text into a
// handoff, the segmentation becomes decorative and #251's whole point is lost.

 * be spending a session there, `undefined` — meaning sessionless — when it is
 * not. Undefined is already the wrapper's "no session" case, so nothing

 * bought nothing and cost the actor a logged-out page with no error to explain
 * it. What a roaming actor loses is its session on a SENSITIVE origin, which is

 * owns, which is also the whole point.
