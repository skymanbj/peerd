// actor model as a fourth actor type (`actorType:'web'`) that OWNS one tab.
//
// This module is the PURE core (functional core / imperative shell): the
// tab→session binding store, the action-log rolling-summary prompt, and the
// SELF-FENCE that wraps the actor's own accumulated summary as untrusted data.
// The SW (service-worker.js) wires persistence (chrome.storage.session), session
// creation, and the relay; the loop reuses `rolling-summary.js` verbatim. All of
// the security knobs the spec calls out live here so they're unit-testable.
//
// See the spec: docs/specs/DESIGN-17-actor-agents.md §"The web actor".

// origin moves; an API origin is stable, and the actor exists per (chat, origin).

// A real public DNS host: dotted labels ending in an alpha TLD (the git precedent's
// rule). Rejects bare IPs (a numeric `42` is parsed as the IP 0.0.0.42 — dots but a
