// @ts-check
// peerd-runtime/actor — what to SAY the agent is doing, in the page it drives.
//
// PURE (tool name + args in → one short phrase out), so the wording is testable
// without a browser and the imperative shell (background/page-activity.js) only
// decides WHEN to show something, never WHAT it says.
//
// why a phrase and not the tool name: this is read by the person whose browser
// is being driven, mid-task, out of the corner of their eye, while they decide
// whether it is safe to touch the keyboard. "type" is jargon and "running tool:
// type" is worse. "Typing…" is the thing they actually need.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE PHRASE, and why — this is the part to keep
// when editing:
//
//   1. NEVER the typed text. `type` carries the value going into the field,
//      which is exactly where a password, a card number or a 2FA code lives.
//      Painting it into an on-screen banner would put secrets on the user's
//      monitor (and into any screen recording or shared window) that the page
//      itself was masking. The phrase says "Typing…", never what.
//
//   2. NEVER page-derived text — no click selectors, no element labels, no
//      titles. "Clicking Submit" reads better, but a selector is chosen from
//      content the page authored, so echoing it lets a hostile page write the
//      sentence the user reads while deciding whether to intervene. That is the
//      same reasoning the origin-lock handoff report uses when it names an
//      ORIGIN and never a path (actor/origin-lock-report.js).
//
//   3. Only the HOST of a navigation, never the full URL. Same rule: the host
//      is what tells the user where they are going; the path and query are
//      attacker-shaped and carry no extra meaning at a glance.
//
// So every phrase this returns is drawn from a FIXED vocabulary, with at most a
// hostname interpolated. Nothing the model or the page writes reaches the user's
// screen through this surface.
