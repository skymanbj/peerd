// @ts-check
// peerd-runtime/actor — which origins are dedicated identity providers.
// (issue #251, the narrow exemption's input.)
//
// PURE. A URL in, a boolean out. No IO, no storage, no learning — deliberately
// unlike origin-sensitivity.js, and the difference is the whole point.
//
// WHY THIS LIST IS SHORT AND WHY IT MUST STAY SHORT. Saying "this is an IdP" is
// the ONE way a bound actor is allowed off the origin it owns. Everything the
// landing rule then bounds is exact to the origin this file recognizes. The
// actor parks without DOM, fetch, or credential authority while the user owns
// that leg. Every entry still defines where a confirmed sign-in may send the
// user's tab, so a generous list would enlarge a sensitive transition. The
// classifier next door fails OPEN because a miss there declines to add a
// protection; this file fails CLOSED because a false positive here REMOVES one.
//
// THE MEMBERSHIP RULE: an origin qualifies only if signing in is essentially all
// it does. A host like `accounts.google.com` or `login.microsoftonline.com`
// exists to authenticate and nothing else, so a tab sitting there is doing the
// thing we meant to allow. That rule is what excludes the ones people will ask
// about first:
//
//   github.com, gitlab.com, facebook.com — these are full products that ALSO
//   speak OAuth. Admitting them would mean a bound actor sent to "sign in with
//   GitHub" may park the user's tab on the whole of github.com: issues, pull
//   requests, and settings on a site where the user is logged in. That is not a
//   dedicated authentication surface and must not qualify for the exception.
//
// WHAT THE EXCLUSION COSTS, stated plainly rather than buried: a bound actor
// that hits "sign in with GitHub" ENDS. The user sees a helper that stopped, not
// a helper that quietly did something on GitHub. That is the failure we want if
// we must have one, but it IS a failure, and whether it happens often enough to
// change the design is a question for real use rather than for this comment.
// Widening the list is a one-line change; unwidening it after a hijack is not.
