// @ts-check
// peerd-runtime/actor — what happens when a web actor's tab lands somewhere.
// (issue #251, the decision half.)
//
// PURE. State in, verdict out. No IO, no clock of its own (`now` is injected),
// no knowledge of tabs or gates — so every branch below is exhaustively
// testable and the enforcement points stay thin.
//
// THE ONE RULE, and the reason this file is small:
//
//     Judge the LANDING, never the request.
//
// A tab's origin can change three ways:
//   1. the actor calls navigate()                     — a tool call we see
//   2. that navigation 302s somewhere else            — NO tool call for the hop
//   3. the page redirects itself (meta refresh / JS)  — no tool call at all
// Checking `args.url` catches only (1), and is defeated by any open redirect —
// which is not hypothetical: navigate.js RE-STAMPS the actor's pin to wherever
// the tab landed, so today (2) silently launders an origin change into an owned
// one. Testing where the tab ACTUALLY IS collapses all three into one check
// that no redirect chain can walk around.
//
// WHY A ROAMING ACTOR IS STOPPED RATHER THAN WARNED. An earlier draft let a
// roaming actor enter a credentialed site and relied on #242's forced confirm
// to catch the bad case. That makes the user's attention the boundary, which is
// backwards: a confirm is a backstop for where a boundary is missing, not a
// substitute for one. A roaming actor never holds the authority in the first
// place, so there is nothing for a hijack to spend.
//
// FAIL CLOSED, EVERYWHERE. This file's whole job is to REMOVE an authority an
// actor would otherwise keep, so an unrecognized input must never read as
// permission. Two places where a first draft got that backwards, both found in
// review and both now explicit: an unrecognized `mode` ends the actor rather
// than falling through, and a landing we cannot canonicalize is treated as
// FOREIGN rather than as "no page".

 *
 * decideLanding runs when a DOM tool resolves a tab. But `ctx.activeTab.origin`

 * with `withSessionScopedCredentials(webFetch, () => ctx.activeTab?.origin)`,
 * read live on every request. So the moment a page redirects itself onto a
 * credentialed origin, the actor's fetch scope moves there too — with no tool
 * call in between for decideLanding to judge. `fetch_url`, `read_web_cache` and
 * the `site_client_*` tools never pass through resolveTargetTab, so they can
 * spend that scope before any DOM tool re-enters the chokepoint.
 *
 * This closes that window because it is SYNCHRONOUS and can therefore sit
 * directly inside the scope getter, where an async judge cannot. It is a
 * narrowing, never a widening: it can only withhold a scope the pre-#251 code
 * would have handed over.
