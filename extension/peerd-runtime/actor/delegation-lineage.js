// @ts-check
// delegation-lineage — the PURE trust decision for the "spawned as async
// actors" refactor (PR #134, WIRED — the sender gate in actor-messaging.js
// routes through mayMessageActor and stamps messageProvenance on envelopes).
//
// PROBLEM. Today a spawned actor and a bound (message_actor) actor are two
// different async lifecycles. The one that matters here: a spawned actor
// CANNOT message a bound actor, so it can't drive a tab / VM / notebook the
// way the orchestrator can.
// What blocks it is the sender gate's IDENTITY check
// (actor/actor-messaging.js — `senderSessionId !== active` refuses), which
// uses "are you the foreground chat" as a stand-in for "are you trusted." A
// spawned actor runs under a child session id that is never `currentSessionId`, so it
// is refused even though it is a first-party descendant of the active chat.
//
// THE FIX (this file is its crux). Replace the `=== active` identity check with
// a trusted-LINEAGE check: a session may message an actor when it is the active
// chat OR a descendant of it reached ENTIRELY through trusted SPAWN edges. Two
// walls stay exactly as they are:
//   1. the inbound wall — `inbound === true` still refuses. `inbound` is the
//      turn's untrusted-origin flag (synthetic && !trusted, service-worker.js).
//      It is what keeps an injected/synthetic re-entry from delegating, and it is
//      ALSO what keeps an async-actor's RESULT-wake from delegating (that wake
//      re-enters the parent trusted:false → inbound:true), preserving the explicit
//      "a parent reacting to a child result is not trusted to delegate" decision.
//      So the RESULT edge needs no handling here: the inbound wall already covers it.
//   2. the capability strip — message_actor's ctx closure survives only for a ctx
//      whose toolset grants message_actor (spawn.js CAPABILITY_CONSUMERS). A
//      tools:[] fan-out child still can't delegate. Unchanged.
//
// THE HOLE THIS CLOSES (why lineage alone is not enough). An INBOUND turn on the
// active chat is refused message_actor directly — but it can still call
// actor_create, and the child it spawns runs non-inbound turns. Without care,
// that child would be a "descendant of the active chat" and could message actors
// on the injected turn's behalf — laundering delegation around the inbound wall.
// So a spawn edge is trusted ONLY when the spawning turn was itself trusted
// (not inbound). The shell stamps that verdict onto the child at spawn time
// (`spawnedTrusted`), and one untrusted spawn taints its whole subtree. Because
// parentSessionId is set server-side at sessions.create (never model-supplied),
// the ancestry chain itself is not attacker-forgeable; the only thing that can
// downgrade trust is an inbound spawning turn, which is exactly what we taint on.
//
// PURE (no IO) → Bun-testable. The imperative shell (actor-messaging.js, once
// wired) builds `ancestry` by walking parentSessionId up from the sender via the
// session store, then asks this function yes/no. This function reads values only.

// Feature flag for the refactor — ON: the sender gate (actor-messaging.js)
// routes through mayMessageActor(), spawned run under abortable,
// timeout-bounded turn slots (spawn.js), and envelopes carry provenance.
// Kept (not deleted) so the gate can revert to the strict `=== active`
// identity check with a one-line flip if a field problem surfaces; OFF
// restores the pre-#134 sender gate, everything else stands.

// ── mailbox provenance — the choke-point judgement ──────────────────────────
//
// An actor is a serialized CHOKE POINT: one tab (or one origin), one mailbox,
// one turn at a time. While only the foreground chat messages it, "who sent
// this" is trivial. Once actors are SHARED — a web actor on a tab that several
// orchestrators or spawned all message — the actor (and the mailbox in front
// of it) must arbitrate: coalesce an accidental duplicate, order competing
// requests, cancel one a newer message supersedes, or keep unrelated senders
// fair. To make that call it needs each message's PROVENANCE: who sent it, and
// on whose behalf.
//
// The trusted-lineage chain already carries exactly that, so provenance is free
// once the gate has it. The shell stamps it onto the message ENVELOPE
// (denormalized) so the actor never has to walk the store mid-turn.
//
// why the envelope, not a structured session id: session ids are uuidv7
// (time-sortable, globally-unique store keys); overloading them with a parent
// path is brittle to parse and length-bound. The envelope carries the full
// reference instead — same capability (the actor can name the parent), no id
// overloading. Encoding it into the id is an owner call; the shape is the same.
