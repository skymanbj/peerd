// @ts-check
// DESIGN-17 — message_actor: the channel to a tab-hosted instance's actor.
//
// You don't mutate an instance; you message its ACTOR — a GenServer-style OTP
// process (started on demand, addressed by a registered name, the resolved actor
// session its live PID) that exclusively holds that environment's tools. This
// orchestrator is the direct analog of async-actors (actor/async-actors.js):
// a MAILBOX over turnSlots processed one message at a time (never interrupts an
// in-flight turn), a SW-captured correlation (the sender is closed over, not trusted
// from the actor), a wrapUntrusted-fenced reply that re-enters the sender as a
// synthetic wake, and a per-sender runaway guard. Functional core / imperative shell:
// every IO surface is injected, so the spawn → run → reply flow is unit-testable.
//
// ONE reply shape for EVERY kind (web included). The orchestrator does not block BY
// DEFAULT: it hands a task to an actor and gets woken with the reply on a later turn
// via deliver()/runWhenIdle — the actor model, uniformly. The one exception is the
// opt-in `await:true` (message_actor), which resolves the fenced reply into the tool
// result so the orchestrator can answer in the SAME turn instead of deferring; it is
// bounded by a wall-clock cap that degrades back to the later-turn wake, so even the
// blocking shape cannot park a turn indefinitely or drop a reply. The actor's own turn slot
// serializes its turns (one actor per tab/instance); deliver() wrapUntrusted-
// fences the reply, so a web actor's page-derived reply is fenced like any other
// untrusted content. (Web used to be a sync-await special case — collapsed into
// this path; it never blocked the orchestrator, and the fence is now uniform.)
//
// Durable mailbox (P1). The correlation is persisted (deps.mailbox): an SW death
// between accept and deliver() no longer drops the reply-wake. Each entry is
// persisted as queued, then moved to started before actor work can begin. Boot
// recovery never executes a stored request automatically. Queued work is reported
// as Not run; started or legacy work is reported as outcome unknown. The default
// no-op mailbox keeps pure-heap tests lightweight.
//
// Posture (PR #134 — spawned as async actors): a message is accepted when the
// turn is NOT `inbound` AND the sender passes the TRUSTED-LINEAGE gate
// (delegation-lineage.js mayMessageActor): the active foreground chat, or a
// descendant of it reached entirely through trusted spawn edges (spawn.js
// stamps `spawnedTrusted` per hop; one inbound spawn taints its subtree).
// `inbound` is the untrusted-ORIGIN signal the turn driver folds from
// synthetic + trusted: `inbound = synthetic && !trusted`. So a real user turn,
// an explicit first-party continuation (a goal turn, or the orchestrator
// reacting to an actor's reply — both set trusted:true), and a trusted-lineage
// actor MAY delegate; an untrusted/external synthetic turn (future peer
// messages / scheduled tasks — never trusted) is refused. Fail-CLOSED: a
// missing/unwalkable ancestry admits only the foreground chat itself.
//
// The runaway guard + Stop bookkeeping are keyed by the lineage ROOT
// (messageProvenance) rather than the raw sender, so a parent↔child↔actor
// cycle shares ONE budget (phase 4) and a user Stop on the chat cascades to
// actor turns its descendants started (phase 5). Envelopes (durable mailbox
// entries) carry the provenance so a boot redrain can arbitrate: a reply whose
// awaiting sender was an EPHEMERAL actor (dead after restart) is rerouted
// to the root instead of waking a headless child (phase 7).
//
// Reply modes: the ORCHESTRATOR (and any long-lived chat session) gets the
// async wake — deliver() re-enters it on a later turn. A ACTOR sender sets
// `awaitReply`: it is a fire-once call-site with no later turn, so its reply
// resolves INTO the message_actor tool result (still wrapUntrusted-fenced).
// why not wake an actor like a chat: the reenter path runs sessions under
// the SW's main turn driver — waking a finished child would both run an
// orphan turn nobody consumes AND rebuild its context on the MAIN exposure
// surface, escalating past the child's narrowed toolset.

// Two honest notes on this set, so the next reader doesn't mistake it for a

//   - 'api' is belt-and-braces. An API integration resolves to kind 'web' with

//     today. It stays because the PROMPT half narrows on actorType === 'web',
//     which covers both backings — dropping 'api' would make the two halves
//     disagree the moment a resolver changes.
//   - 'dweb' is deliberately ABSENT and arguably should not be. The dweb actor
//     ingests inbound peer DMs and A2A output — as untrusted as page bytes.
//     It is excluded only because it is preview-only and its reply shape has
//     not been exercised against the envelope; extending the set is a follow-up
//     that needs its own prompt half, not a one-word edit here.
