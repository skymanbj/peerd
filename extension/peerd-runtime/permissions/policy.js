// @ts-check
// Permission policy — Plan/Act mode + the confirm-actions toggle (Feature 03).
//
// This is the FOUNDATIONAL write-authorization layer. Features 02, 08,
// 09, 05 route every write through `decideAction` here. It is a pure
// function (functional core): given (mode, confirmActions, tool) → a
// verdict the dispatcher acts on. No IO, no chrome.*, no awaits. The
// dispatcher's imperative shell turns the verdict into a gate-block or a
// confirm round-trip.
//
// WHY a second axis on top of the origin gate (the denylist):
//   - The origin gate (peerd-egress) answers "which ORIGINS may a tool
//     touch."
//   - This policy answers "may the agent WRITE at all, and must it ask
//     first." Cline's Plan/Act is the reference. The two axes compose:
//     an action must clear BOTH the origin gate AND this permission gate.
//
// HISTORY (owner decision, 2026-06-12): Act used to carry three Codex-
// CLI-style tiers (suggest / auto-edit / full-auto). Nobody could say
// what full-auto *was* relative to Plan/Act, and the middle tier did
// overlapping work — so the tiers collapsed into ONE boolean,
// `confirmActions`: ON = the old suggest (every non-read confirms),
// OFF = the old full-auto (nothing confirms). Records carry only
// `confirmActions`; `confirmActionsFromRecord` below reads it off a
// stored record.
//
// WHY it lives in peerd-runtime/permissions (not peerd-egress):
//   Plan/Act is an ORCHESTRATION concern — it's about what the agent is
//   allowed to DO in a session, mirroring personas (Read/Act) which the
//   ARCHITECTURE already homes in peerd-runtime. The denylist stays in
//   egress because it's about the network/origin security boundary.
//   ARCHITECTURE.md §2.4 reserves peerd-runtime/personas for exactly
//   this "whether the agent can act at all" axis; Plan/Act is its V1
//   realization, generalized from terminal Build/Plan to the browser's
//   bigger surface (DOM + tabs + fetch + shell, not just files).

/** @typedef {import('/shared/tool-types.js').Tool} Tool */
/** @typedef {import('/shared/tool-types.js').SideEffect} SideEffect */

// --- Modes (the top axis) --------------------------------------------------

export const PERMISSION_MODES = Object.freeze({
  // PLAN — read-only plus pure navigation. The agent may observe (read
  // pages, query the DOM, inspect state, search) and LOAD URLs (the
  // navigation carve-out below), but may NOT mutate anything: no
  // file/workspace writes, no shell, no side-effecting fetch, and — the
  // browser-native part — no side-effecting DOM actions (click/type/
  // navigate/page_exec). Bigger blast radius than a terminal's
  // "plan", so the block list is bigger too.
  PLAN: /** @type {const} */ ('plan'),
  // ACT — writes allowed, subject to the confirmActions toggle.
  ACT: /** @type {const} */ ('act'),
});

// Safe FLOOR (read-only): the value the normalizers and the dispatcher's
// defensive fallback land on for garbage/missing input. NOTE: peerd's actual
// product default for a fresh install is ACT (acting on the browser is the
// point) — that's applied in the SW's resolvePermission, not here, so a
// corrupted record still fails safe to read-only.
export const DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE = PERMISSION_MODES.PLAN;

// --- The confirm toggle (the ACT sub-axis) ----------------------------------
//
// ON  (true)  — every non-read action round-trips to the user first.
// OFF (false) — nothing confirms; the agent runs until the user halts.
//
// Safe FLOOR (most-confirming) for garbage/missing input is ON. The
// fresh-install product default is OFF (act without nagging) — applied in
// the SW's resolvePermission, not here, so a corrupted record still fails
// safe to confirming.
export const DEFAULT_CONFIRM_ACTIONS = true;

// --- Action-class taxonomy -------------------------------------------------
//
// Tools carry a `sideEffect` (read | write | mutate_external |
// destructive) and a `primitive` (inspect | tab | web | webvm | notebook
// | app | actor | time). The policy collapses the (sideEffect,
// primitive) pair into ONE of four action CLASSES. The confirm rule
// itself no longer distinguishes the non-read classes (anything non-read
// confirms when confirmActions is ON), but the taxonomy STAYS: the
// lineage UI and the confirm prompt label actions by class, and the
// review orchestrator intersects on READ. This is the single place the
// taxonomy is encoded; the dispatcher and the UI both read it from here.

export const ACTION_CLASSES = Object.freeze({
  READ: /** @type {const} */ ('read'),
  // Writes confined to the agent's OWN workspace: WebVM disk, Notebook
  // OPFS, App bodies. Reversible, sandboxed, no effect on the user's live
  // web session.
  WORKSPACE_WRITE: /** @type {const} */ ('workspace_write'),
  // Code execution: booting a VM, eval in the Notebook, page_exec/page_eval
  // (arbitrary JS in a live page). Higher stakes than a file write — can
  // do anything within its runtime.
  SHELL: /** @type {const} */ ('shell'),
  // Acts on the user's LIVE web session or the outside world: DOM
  // mutations on real pages (click/type/navigate), tab opens,
  // form submits, downloads, cross-origin fetch, deletes. The dangerous
  // bucket.
  EXTERNAL: /** @type {const} */ ('external'),
});

// Primitives whose *writes* are LOCAL — the agent's own sandbox (webvm/
// notebook/pod/app) or the dweb node's own state (dweb_block's blocklist,
// dweb_discovery's switch) — rather than against the user's live browser
// session. A `write` sideEffect on one of these is WORKSPACE_WRITE; a `write`
// on a `tab` primitive (click/type/navigate) is EXTERNAL. (dweb_share/install
// are `mutate_external`, so they're EXTERNAL regardless of primitive.)
// 'engine' is sandbox_create's cross-kind primitive — a create of the agent's
// own sandbox is a workspace write exactly like the per-kind creates it folded.
const WORKSPACE_PRIMITIVES = Object.freeze(new Set(['webvm', 'notebook', 'pod', 'app', 'engine', 'dweb']));

// Specific tools whose write is really code EXECUTION, not a file edit.
// These live in workspace primitives but get classified SHELL so the
// lineage and confirm prompt say what they are (booting a VM or
// evaluating arbitrary JS is a bigger step than writing a file).
const SHELL_TOOLS = Object.freeze(new Set([
  'vm_boot',     // boots/executes the Linux VM
  'js_notebook',     // runs arbitrary JS in the Notebook worker
  'pod_exec',    // runs shell/JS/WASI with files, Git, and brokered egress
  'page_exec',   // CDP Runtime.evaluate in a live page
  'page_eval',   // executeScript in a live page
  'script',      // headless JS with egress + delegation — the strongest code lane must not confirm softer than the rest
]));
// Deliberately NOT in SHELL_TOOLS — don't "fix" these:
//   site_client_run  runs code, but capability-stripped to an origin-pinned
//                    fetch whose writes confirm at the SW route (web:write);
//                    it stays sideEffect:'read' at the tool.
//   page_code        its every effect crosses the gated DOM tools it maps
//                    onto, which carry their own classes — classifying the
//                    wrapper as shell would double-prompt.
