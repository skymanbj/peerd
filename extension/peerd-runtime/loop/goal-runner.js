// turns in the MAIN session until the agent declares the goal met (the
// complete_goal tool), or a safety cap / the user's Stop ends it.
//
// This is the loop the mode-row Goal toggle drives — just the ordinary agent
// turn, re-entered:
//   - turn 1 is the user's goal text (a REAL, visible message);
//   - every later turn is a hidden `synthetic` continuation nudge, so the
//     chat reads like a normal session that simply doesn't stop to wait for
//     you — reasoning + tool calls stream inline exactly as always.
// The agent ends the run by calling complete_goal (revealed only while a run
// is active — see tools/exposure.js). A hard iteration cap and the Stop
// button are the backstops behind "until it's done".
//
// Run state is keyed by session id and MIRRORED to storage (the injected kv),
// so a run survives an SW restart and keeps going while the user is in another
// chat: resume() (called on vault unlock) re-drives any persisted active run.
// Each chat owns at most one run. Functional-core / imperative-shell: `runTurn`
// (runAgentTurn), `onEvent`, and `kv` are injected, so the control logic is
// otherwise pure and unit-testable with fakes (kv optional → pure in-memory).

// Hard backstop on autonomous turns — generous for real multi-step work,
// still a wall against a run that never calls complete_goal. The Stop button
// and complete_goal are the normal exits; this only catches a stuck agent.
