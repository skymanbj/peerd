// Shared, pure extraction of a durable engine-instance handle (an App /
// Notebook / WebVM id, plus its name when present) from a tool-result body.
//
// why a shared module: handle retention is a load-bearing capability promise
// — "if a session creates an app or workbook it retains where that is even
// after summarization/trim." Two awareness carriers keep that promise and
// must agree on what a handle IS: the lineage spine (lineage-compaction.js)
// that survives body-compaction, and the trim summary's mechanical handle
// harvest (rolling-summary.js) that survives a deep trim. One definition,
// two readers — pushed DOWN the graph so neither reaches sideways.

// Engine-instance primitives — results from these carry a DURABLE handle
// (an App / Notebook / WebVM id) the agent may need to reference later. A
// stray `"id":` in a web/page result must NOT be mined as a handle, so the
// extractor is scoped to exactly these. 'engine' is the merged
// sandbox_create's cross-kind primitive — its result JSON stamps a `kind`
// field naming which of the three it made (read back below, so the harvested
// handle still says WHICH kind of instance the id is).

 *   - the RAW create body, JSON-then-notes: `{"id":"app-7f3a","name":"…"}…`
 *     (a full JSON.parse would throw on the trailing notes, so a cheap,
 *     anchored regex reads the leading object's fields).
 *   - an already-rendered lineage SPINE: `… · id=app-7f3a "dashboard" · …`
 *     (compaction runs before trim, so the harvester often sees the spine,
 *     not the original body).
 * The id pattern is anchored and length-bounded so a crafted `name` can't
 * smuggle a second `"id":` past the FIRST (real) one. Returns null when
 * there's nothing durable to carry.
 *
 * @param {string|undefined} primitive   the result's engine primitive
 * @param {unknown} content              the result body (raw or spine)
 * @returns {{ id: string, name: string, kind: string } | null}
