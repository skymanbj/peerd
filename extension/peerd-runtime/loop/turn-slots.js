// @ts-check
// Per-session turn slots — the concurrency contract for in-flight turns.
//
// One slot per SESSION, not one global slot. The original single-slot
// design meant sending a message in ANY chat aborted whatever turn was
// streaming in any OTHER chat — navigating to a second conversation and
// chatting there silently killed the first one's stream (owner report,
// 2026-06-12). The rules this module encodes:
//
//   - claim(sessionId): sending into a chat that is ALREADY streaming
//     aborts that chat's turn first (steer-live — the new message
//     supersedes). A turn streaming in a DIFFERENT chat is untouched.
//   - release is self-scoped: a superseded turn unwinding late can only
//     clear its OWN claim, never the newer turn that replaced it.
//   - stop(sessionId) aborts that session's turn only — the side
//     panel's Stop button must never reach across conversations.
//   - runWhenIdle(sessionId, fn): run fn the moment the session has no
//     live turn — NOW if idle, else after the current turn RELEASES.
//     why: an async actor finishing must re-enter its parent as a new
//     turn (DESIGN-11), but the parent may be mid-turn (the user is
//     chatting with it). claim() would steer-abort that live turn — a
//     focus/work theft (DECISIONS #20). runWhenIdle waits for the slot
//     instead of seizing it. The queued fn is contracted to START a turn
//     (claim the slot); that turn's own release drains the next queued
//     wake, so wakes serialise instead of racing each other's claim.
//
// Pure with respect to IO: holds only AbortControllers in memory. The
// service worker is the imperative shell that binds these slots to the
// agent loop, the side-panel port, and auto-memory's busy gate.

// WHY the abort carries a REASON. Both paths below abort the same controller, but
// they mean opposite things to work the turn had delegated: Stop means "end it", a
// steer means "also do this" — the user added a message, they did not ask for the
// web actor mid-fetch to be thrown away. A bare abort() is indistinguishable at the
// listener, so an awaited delegation had to treat every abort as a cancel and
// destroyed in-flight actor work on a steer. These reasons let a listener tell them
// apart (actor-messaging.js routes a steer through degrade-to-async instead of
// cancelling). Plain strings, compared by identity-free equality: the signal crosses
// no worker boundary, but a string survives one and an Error subclass would not.
