// The durable-surface registry (contract §11.1 + §12) — WHICH stores are
// durable, what schema version this build speaks for each, and how far
// each one's data is allowed to travel.
//
// §11.1: every durable surface carries its OWN schema version. The
// numbers here ratchet INDEPENDENTLY — bumping `sessions` says nothing
// about `memory`, so a change to one surface never forces a lockstep
// migration of the rest. `guardStore` (store-version.js) consumes these
// numbers as its `supported` input; this file is the only place they are
// declared.
//
// §12: durability tiers say how long a surface's data is scoped to live,
// and `portable` says whether it may cross installs at all. Device-bound
// state (a non-extractable key handle, an OPFS root, a tab id) is
// STRUCTURALLY untransferable — so the export must NAME what it left
// behind rather than silently shipping a profile that is missing it.
//
// Pure policy plus an injected boot shell. Nothing here touches chrome.*
// storage directly.

 *   EPHEMERAL  dies with the process that made it (a turn, a worker
 *              heap, a service-worker generation); never persisted, so
 *              never in this registry.
 *   SESSION    outlives the process but is scoped to one conversation /
 *              engine session; meaningless once that session is gone.
 *   PROFILE    outlives every session, scoped to this install's profile;
 *              the default for durable state.
 *   PORTABLE   scoped to the USER, not the install — designed to be
 *              carried to another peerd via export/import.
