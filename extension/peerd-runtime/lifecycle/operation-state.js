//
// Every operation that can outlive one synchronous call carries exactly one
// of these states. The contract's core guarantee lives here: peerd never
// silently reports an uncertain side effect as definitely failed or
// definitely completed. `outcome_unknown` is a real terminal state with its
// own resolution rules — it can only leave via positive evidence, never by
// an automatic timeout-to-failed conversion.
//
// Functional core: values in, verdicts out. No IO, no clock. The imperative
// shells (SW dispatcher, operation log, reconciler) enforce these tables at
// every transition.
