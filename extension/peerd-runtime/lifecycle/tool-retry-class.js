// @ts-check
// Tool → retry class. The lifecycle contract's §16.1 obligation — "every
// side-effecting tool has a retry classification" — realized as ONE pure
// function over a tool DESCRIPTOR.
//
// why a descriptor and not the tool objects themselves: importing
// BUILTIN_TOOLS here would drag every def's chrome.* / engine-client import
// graph into a module that must stay pure, IO-free and browser-free
// (functional core, imperative shell). The classifier reads only
// { name, sideEffect, primitive, retryClass } — the shape every tool already
// declares in /shared/tool-types.js — so the dispatcher can classify a
// registered tool and a Bun test can classify the entire live inventory
// without a browser.
//
// The decision order, and why it is that order:
//   1. an explicit, VALID `tool.retryClass`. A def may state its own class.
//      An INVALID one is IGNORED and falls through to derivation — silently
//      accepting garbage that looked authoritative is the worst outcome
//      available here, because it would license a replay nobody sanctioned.
//   2. `destructive` → Class E, unconditionally. The one declaration no name
//      override may soften: an irreversible delete is never auto-repeated.
//   3. the by-NAME override table below — the knowledge the (sideEffect,
//      primitive) pair structurally cannot carry: a `read` that costs a
//      network round trip, a "workspace write" whose payload is arbitrary
//      code, a call that BOOTS something outliving it.
//   4. the declared taxonomy, failing CLOSED. Anything the rules do not
//      positively recognize as safe is Class E — the same posture
//      normalizeRetryClass takes for a missing class, for the same reason:
//      guessing "safe to retry" is the unsafe-replay failure the contract
//      forbids.
