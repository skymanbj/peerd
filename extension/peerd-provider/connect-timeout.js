// Connect-timeout + connection-drop retry for streaming provider calls.
//
// A model call can hang forever if the server never sends response HEADERS.
// fetch() resolves on headers — BEFORE the SSE body — so we guard ONLY the
// initial response with a timeout and CLEAR it the moment headers arrive. The
// (potentially long, healthy) token stream then flows UNTIMED. Composes with the
// caller's Stop signal so the user can still abort mid-call.
//
// The same seam also hosts the connection-drop retry (owner request: "bake in
// model retries if a connection drops when you try to send a message, just 3
// times max"): when the initial fetch REJECTS at the network level — fetch
// surfaces connection reset/refused/DNS blips as a bare TypeError — the call
// is retried with a short backoff. See fetchInitialResponseWithRetry below
// for the exact semantics and the deliberate non-retry cases.
//
// Pure-ish: fetchFn + signals + sleep injected, so it's unit-testable.
