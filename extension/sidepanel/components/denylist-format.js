 * protected from" at a glance and still opens to the individual pattern.
 *
 * Two rules that matter:
 *  - COUNTS COME FROM THE DATA. `total` is the category's real size, `shown` is
 *    how many survive the search. Nothing is hardcoded, so a seed edit can never
 *    leave the UI quietly lying about how many patterns are enforced.
 *  - A GROUP NEVER DISAPPEARS. A category with zero search hits stays listed at
 *    `0 of N`, because a list that silently drops empty groups reads as "these
 *    protections don't exist" — the opposite of the truth.
 *
 * A seed pattern the user DISABLED is not in `active`, so it appears in its
 * category's `shown` count only once re-enabled; the disabled section below the
 * groups is where it lives meanwhile.
