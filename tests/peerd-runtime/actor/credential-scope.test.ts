// `ctx.activeTab.origin` is not just where the DOM tools point: it IS the web
// actor's session-credential scope, read live on every request by
// withSessionScopedCredentials. So a page that redirects itself onto a
// credentialed origin moves that scope with no tool call in between for the
// async judge to see, and `fetch_url` / `read_web_cache` / `site_client_*` never
// pass through resolveTargetTab at all.
//
// This getter is the answer, and its shape is the point: SYNCHRONOUS (so it can
// live inside the scope getter), SIDE-EFFECT-FREE (it is called per request, and
// must not spend excursion budget), and NARROWING ONLY (it can withhold a scope,
// never grant one).
