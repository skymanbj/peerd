// web-target.ts — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the `web` packaging target.
// The web tree IMPORTS real extension source rather than carrying
// hand-vendored copies, so it inherits upstream automatically. This file
// declares exactly WHICH source is staged, plus the few web-specific swaps
// that make an extension tree load on a plain page. Change curation here and
// nowhere else; check-web-boundary.ts then proves the staged tree stays
// import-closed.
//
// The target is deliberately LIBRARY-LIKE: the staged modules plus a minimal
// smoke shell (packaging/templates/web-shell/), no demo UI and no deploy
// pipeline. The archived
// demo shells live on their preserved branches, not here.
//
// why a page needs any divergence at all: three things in the extension tree
// assume the browser-extension platform and would 404/throw at module load on
// a page. Each is a committed-template SWAP (never a text transform): the
// browser-polyfill (no-throw shim) and two tab-group-title constants that
// curated tool defs import from /background/.
