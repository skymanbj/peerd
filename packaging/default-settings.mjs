// Channel-aware default settings — the single schema both channels'
// CHANNEL_DEFAULTS are generated from. PACKAGE-TIME INPUT ONLY: nothing in
// the extension imports this file; packaging/gen-channel-config.ts flattens it
// per channel into extension/shared/channel-config.js (and into the staged
// copy of each artifact). See PACKAGING.md §"Channel-aware defaults".
//
// Each key maps to { store, preview } values. A key present for only one
// channel is OMITTED from the other channel's CHANNEL_DEFAULTS entirely —
// there is no runtime conditional; the field simply doesn't exist in
// that package.
//
// THE PRINCIPLE (spec §11): safety defaults stay strict across both
// channels; only FRICTION defaults relax on preview. Egress allowlist
// posture, the sensitive-site denylist, vault encryption — none of those
// are settings here, and none may become channel-conditional. The
// channel boundary is friction tolerance, not safety floor.
//
// Also: don't proliferate channel-conditional values. Every store/preview
// divergence is a small permanent maintenance tax — add one only when it
// genuinely serves the audience split. Most keys below are deliberately
// identical.
//
// Migration semantics are Option A (spec §11): a stored value always wins
// over CHANNEL_DEFAULTS, even if it happens to equal an old default. New
// defaults reach existing users only when they reset the setting.

  // "voice auto-on for preview" example.)
  voiceEnabled: { store: false, preview: false },
